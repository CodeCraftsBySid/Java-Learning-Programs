Java Mini Project - Snake, Water, and Gun Game

Welcome to this page dedicated to the popular game "Snake, Water, and Gun"!

Congratulations on reaching this point and let the fun begin!

This project revolves around implementing the Snake, Water, and Gun game using Java. It is a two-player game where each player randomly selects one of the three options: snake, water, or gun. In this version, we will create a game for a single player to play against the computer.

Here are the rules of the game:

- Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water, resulting in a win for the snake.
- Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, giving a point to water.
- Gun vs. Snake: The gun will kill the snake, leading to a win for the gun.

If both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

At the beginning of the game, you have the option to choose the number of matches you want to play in a series. At the end of the series, the final result will be displayed.

Wishing you the best of luck!

Thank you for joining us, and we hope you enjoy playing the game!
